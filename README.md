max patch for image recombination 

https://philip-meyer.com/alluvium


this patch uses the jit.mo and syphon packages for max for non-essential purposes (modulation and image export, respectively). both packages can be found in the max package manager.

it also uses the bfg lfo for modulation, which can be found here: https://github.com/pdmeyer/bfg-lfo
